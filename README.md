# movie_analysis
A project for providing insight into which movies a CEO should be creating to meet consumer demand.

## Project Members

- Joseph Cohen
- Garrett DuCharme

## Goals

The goal of this project is to determine which kinds of movies Microsoft should be producing in order to maximize viewer satisfation as well as profits. In order to determine which movies to produce, we will first look at viewer ratings based on genre. For genres that do well, we will use the ratios between both domestic and international profits with the production cost as a metric to determine which movies to focus on to maximize profits. Lastly, we will look to see which directors, writers, and actors appear most frequently among the highest rated and highest grossing movies in each genre. These statistics will be used to determine which industry stars Microsoft should try to hire in order to consistently produce high quality, profitable content. All of this analysis will be focused on movies produced no earlier than 2010 in order to best reflect what the market currently demands.
